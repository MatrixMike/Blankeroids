Blankeroids
===========

Asteroids using Haskell, Yampa, and BlankCanvas

This is a version of Asteroids for Haskell written using the FRP DSL Yampa.  It uses the University of Kansas's blank-canvas
library to provide graphical output to a web browser.  After starting the Blankeroids executable from the command line,
the output may be displayed by poining a browser to http://localhost:3000.

Left and Right arrows turn the ship, Up arrow provides thrust, Down arrow is hyperspace, and the space key fires the cannon.
